# Licentia Publica Christiana (LPC) v. 1.0
(Christian Public Licence)

## Preamble
This Licence, the **Licentia Publica Christiana (LPC)**, also referred to as the Christian Public Licence ("Licence"), is a free, copyleft Licence for software and other kinds of works. It is designed to ensure and promote the freedom to share, study, modify, and improve such works for all users, while fostering a spirit of community and stewardship grounded in enduring Christian values. It seeks to ensure that all versions of a work, including modified versions, remain available to the community under terms that respect these freedoms, principles, and the central affirmation of faith detailed herein.

This Licence is offered by the **Christian Institute of Works (CIW)** in the hope that it will be useful, encourage cooperation, and contribute to a commons of creative and technical works that reflect both innovation and Christian principle.

When we speak of free software or free works, we refer to freedom, not price. This Licence is designed to ensure that You have the freedom to distribute copies of free works (and charge for them if You wish), that You receive Source Code or can get it if You want it, that You can change the works or use pieces of them in new free programs, and that You know You can do these things, all while acknowledging a foundational truth.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, modification, and affirmation follow.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

**0. Definitions.**

*   "This Licence" refers to Version 1.0 of the **Licentia Publica Christiana (LPC)** (the Christian Public Licence).
*   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks or sui generis database rights.
*   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this Licence. Each licensee is addressed as "You." "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
*   "The Author" refers to the individual(s) or entity(ies) who originally placed the Program under this Licence.
*   "To Modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "Modified Version" of the earlier work or a work "Based On" the earlier work.
*   "Covered Work" means either the unmodified Program or a work Based On the Program.
*   "To Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make You directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable Copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
*   "To Convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
*   "Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object Code" means any non-source form of a work.
*   "Corresponding Source" for a work in Object Code form means all the Source Code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the Object Code and to Modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
*   "The Sacred Affirmation" refers to the precise phrase: **"Christ is Risen"**.
*   "Appropriate Legal Notices" means, to the extent that an interactive user interface includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, (2) displays The Sacred Affirmation as required by Section 3b, (3) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), (4) tells licensees they may Convey the work under this Licence, and (5) tells the user how to view a copy of this Licence. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
*   "LPC-Compatible Licence" means a licence that imposes substantively equivalent obligations to this Licence, particularly regarding the propagation of Corresponding Source, the ShareAlike condition, and the inclusion of The Sacred Affirmation, and is designated as compatible by the **Christian Institute of Works (CIW)**. (Initially, only this Licence itself is LPC-Compatible).

**1. Basic Permissions.**

All rights granted under this Licence are granted for the term of Copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This Licence explicitly affirms Your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a Covered Work is covered by this Licence only if the output, given its content, constitutes a Covered Work. This Licence acknowledges Your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by Copyright law.

You may make, run and Propagate Covered Works that You do not Convey, without conditions so long as Your licence otherwise remains in force. You may Convey Covered Works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for You, or provide You with facilities for running those works, provided that You comply with the terms of this Licence in conveying all material for which You do not control Copyright. Those thus making or running the Covered Works for You must do so exclusively on Your behalf, under Your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of Your copyrighted material outside their relationship with You.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; Section 8 makes it unnecessary.

**2. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.**

No Covered Work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When You Convey a Covered Work, You waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this Licence with respect to the Covered Work, and You disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, Your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

**3. Licence Conditions.**

Your exercise of the rights granted in Section 1 is expressly made subject to the following conditions:

**a. Attribution.** If You Convey the Program or a Modified Version, You must:
1.  Retain the following if it is supplied by The Author with the Program:
    1.  Identification of The Author(s) of the Program and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by The Author (including by pseudonym if designated);
    2.  A copyright notice;
    3.  A notice that refers to this Licence (the **Licentia Publica Christiana (LPC)**);
    4.  A notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
    5.  A URI or hyperlink to the Program or this Licence to the extent reasonably practicable;
2.  Indicate if You Modified the Program and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
3.  Indicate the Program is licensed under this Licence (the **Licentia Publica Christiana (LPC)**), and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Licence.

You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3a in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Convey the Program. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

**b. The Sacred Affirmation Inclusion.** When You Convey the Program or any Modified Version, in any form (Source Code or Object Code), You MUST ensure that The Sacred Affirmation ("Christ is Risen") is included and displayed prominently and legibly alongside or as an integral part of any copyright notice, licence notice, or Appropriate Legal Notices associated with the work. This requirement applies to all copies or substantial portions, and to any user interfaces where other notices are displayed.

**c. ShareAlike.** If You Convey a Modified Version:
1.  The Modified Version as a whole must be licensed under this Licence (the **Licentia Publica Christiana (LPC)**), or an LPC-Compatible Licence, to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This Licence will therefore apply to the whole of the Modified Version, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This Licence gives no permission to licence the Modified Version in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if You have separately received it.
2.  You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the licence You apply.
3.  You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Modified Version that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the licence You apply.

**d. Conveying Non-Source Forms.** If You Convey a Covered Work in Object Code form, You must also Convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this Licence, in one of these ways:
1.  Convey the Object Code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
2.  Convey the Object Code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as You offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the Object Code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this Licence, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than Your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge; or,
3.  Convey the Object Code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.
4.  If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices.

**e. Remote Network Interaction.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Licence, if You Modify the Program, Your Modified Version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if Your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of Your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source must also be licensed under this Licence (the **Licentia Publica Christiana (LPC)**) or an LPC-Compatible Licence and meet all its conditions, including the inclusion of The Sacred Affirmation.

**4. Additional Terms.**

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this Licence by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. You may place additional permissions on material, added by You to a Covered Work, for which You have or can give appropriate Copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Licence, for material You add to a Covered Work, You may (if authorized by the Copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this Licence with terms:

a.  Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of Sections 10 and 11 of this Licence; or
b.  Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
c.  Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that Modified Versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions." If the Program as You received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this Licence along with a term that is a further restriction, You may remove that term.

**5. Patents.**

Each contributor grants You a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent licence under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, Modify and Propagate the contents of its contributor version. If You Convey a Covered Work, knowingly relying on a patent licence, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this Licence, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then You must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive Yourself of the benefit of the patent licence for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this Licence, to extend the patent licence to downstream recipients.

**6. Termination.**

You may not Propagate or Modify a Covered Work except as expressly provided under this Licence. Any attempt otherwise to Propagate or Modify it is void, and will automatically terminate Your rights under this Licence. However, if You cease all violation of this Licence, then Your licence from a particular Copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the Copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates Your licence, and (b) permanently, if the Copyright holder fails to notify You of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Termination of Your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from You under this Licence.

**7. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.**

You are not required to accept this Licence in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a Covered Work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this Licence grants You permission to Propagate or Modify any Covered Work. These actions infringe Copyright if You do not accept this Licence. Therefore, by Modifying or Propagating a Covered Work, You indicate Your acceptance of this Licence to do so.

**8. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.**

Each time You Convey a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives a licence from the original licensors, to run, Modify and Propagate that work, subject to this Licence. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this Licence. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this Licence.

**9. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.**

If conditions are imposed on You (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this Licence, they do not excuse You from the conditions of this Licence. If You cannot Convey a Covered Work so as to satisfy simultaneously Your obligations under this Licence and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence You may not Convey it at all.

**10. Disclaimer of Warranty.**

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

**11. Limitation of Liability.**

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**12. Interpretation.**

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Licence is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Licence without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

**13. Revised Versions of this Licence.**

The **Christian Institute of Works (CIW)** may publish revised and/or new versions of the **Licentia Publica Christiana (LPC)** from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of this Licence "or any later version" applies to it, You have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the **Christian Institute of Works (CIW)**. If the Program does not specify a version number, You may choose any version ever published.
